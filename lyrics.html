            <big style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'">
            I wasn't jealous before we met
            Now every woman I see is a potential threat
            And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
            You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

            But now it isn't true
            Now everything is new
            And all I've learned has overturned
            I beg of you

            Don't go wasting your emotion
            Lay all your love on me

            It was like shooting a sitting duck
            A little small talk, a smile, and baby I was stuck
            I still don't know what you've done with me
            A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

            I feel a kind of fear
            When I don't have you near
            Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
            I beg you, dear

            Don't go wasting your emotion
            Lay all your love on me
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            Lay all your love on me

            I've had a few little love affairs
            They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
            I used to think I was sensible
            It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

            'Cause everything is new
            And everything is you
            And all I've learned has overturned
            What can I do?

            Don't go wasting your emotion
            Lay all your love on me
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            Lay all your love on me

            Don't go wasting your emotion
            Lay all your love on me
            Don't go sharing your devotion
            Lay all your love on me
            Don't go wasting your emotion
            Lay all your love on me
            </big>
